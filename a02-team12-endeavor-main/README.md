## Vision Statement

### Summary
CookMate is a digital cookbook that enables individuals to discover and follow along with delicious recipes. It also enables them to add, view, share, rate and review various other recipes.

### Description
CookMate is an innovative digital cookbook that allows users to easily add, save, and share their favorite recipes with others. Whether you're a seasoned chef or just starting out in the kitchen, CookMate offers a wide variety of recipes for home cooks around the world. With its user-friendly design, you can easily search for recipes based on ingredients, meal type, or dietary restrictions. CookMate also includes additional features such as recipe rating and sharing, making it easy for you to discover new and delicious recipes. CookMate is the perfect place for anyone who loves to try new dishes and wants to expand their recipe collection and share their own creations with the world. In CookMate, you can add your favorite recipe. 

If you cooked a delicious recipe and want to use it again but are afraid of forgetting how to cook it, CookMate is the solution! You can add your recipe to your profile and retrieve it later to enjoy your dish again. In CookMate, you can share your favorite recipes with your friends. If you found a good recipe and want to share it with your neighbors, friends, or family, you can easily do so with just a simple click. In CookMate, you can rate and leave a review for your recipe. If you found a delicious recipe and want to thank the publisher or if you are a professional chef and want to add a note or review for the publisher, it's easy with CookMate. You can leave and add a rating for the publisher. There are more other features available in CookMate like the ability to select meals that fit your dietary restrictions or find quick and easy default meals.

### Target Audience
This software is designed to provide suitable recipes for all those who are interested in cooking. For instance, home cooks can share their own recipes, and individuals with limited time or money can use the "quick recipe mode" to select recipes that suit their needs. For those who do not have much experience in cooking, the step-by-step, detailed tutorials will help them. The category feature and search will help new moms and people with food restrictions.

### Value Added
CookMate focuses on providing cooks with the ability to quickly and efficiently search for, select, and cook recipes with minimal time and effort. In addition, this software will assist cooks in maintaining healthy eating habits. People waste money on fast food because they don't have time to cook. However, this software will provide access to a variety of quick recipes using grocery ingredients, allowing cooks to not only live a healthier lifestyle but also save time. Furthermore, by using this software, cooks will only buy groceries as recommended, which will help to protect the environment by reducing food waste and save their money.

### Success Criteria
We will gauge the success of this system based on the following criteria:

* Cooks can get to a recipe in 30% fewer clicks than other apps.
* In a survey, more than 65% of cooks respond with “yes” when asked whether or not CookMate is easy to use.
* More than 88% of cooks have saved at least 2 recipes.
* More than 65% of cooks have shared at least 1 recipe.
* More than 25% of cooks view at least 1 recipe per week.
